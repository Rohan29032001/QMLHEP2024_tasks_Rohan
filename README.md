### Completed tasks for Quantum transformer for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC

This repository contains the solutions for the given tasks:
- Task-1
- Task-2
- Task-3
- Task-8

Note: I didn't get time to try a lot of Hyperparameter tuning becuase of academic obligations.


### Summary of Results obtained:
The metrics used here are calculated on the test set. The GNNs were trained with 2 layers only. The saved models have also been uploaded.
